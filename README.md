# Tranquillium

The idea is to create a one stop platform for the mental health and well-being of a person. A person in distress can come to the platform to listen to music playlists, journal, watch funny videos to uplift their mood, and get book, movie, and show recommendations according to their mood and interests. The user should be able to integrate their music playlists on the website and look for existing playlists that suit their mood. They should be able to create an account on the website, which redirects them to their journal, where they can log their daily mood and write about events that occurred during their day and how they made them feel.
They can login to their accounts, interact with others on the platform, and be a part of moderated chat groups based on their interests.
The whole idea of the platform is to make the visitor feel cared for and heard.
Some functionalities that the idea should include are-

1) Upon visiting the website, the person should be able to register their mood on the website.

2) They should be able to get music, books, and show recommendations according to their mood.

3) They should be able to make an account and join chat groups.

4) They should be able to view a graphical representation/calendar view of their mood throughout the month.

5) A personal account on the website that takes them to their digital journal/diary.
